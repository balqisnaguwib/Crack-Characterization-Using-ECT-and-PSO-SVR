# Crack-Characterization-Using-ECT-and-PSO-SVR

 Enhanced PEC probe design by optimizing its shape, size, and coil turns to achieve precise signal 
detection, employing FFT signal processing to mitigate interference effects. 
 Constructed a machine learning model utilizing SVR with PSO and KFCV to achieve 85.16% accuracy 
in accurately quantifying the depth of defects. 
 Designed a user-friendly Python-based software for signal processing and characterization.
